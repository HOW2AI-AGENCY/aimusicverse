## 🎓 Learnings & Decisions

### Architectural Decisions

1. **Separate Player Directory**: Created `src/components/player/` for better organization
2. **Extended usePlayerState**: Added queue management to existing hook instead of creating new hook
3. **@dnd-kit Over react-beautiful-dnd**: Used @dnd-kit for better touch support and performance
4. **Bottom Sheets for Mobile**: Using shadcn/ui Sheet component for consistent mobile UX

### Best Practices Applied

1. **Touch Targets**: All interactive elements ≥44×44px for accessibility
2. **ARIA Labels**: Added proper labels for screen readers
3. **Loading States**: Skeleton loaders for better perceived performance
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Components work without Telegram context

---

## 📚 Documentation

### Component Documentation

All new components include:
- TypeScript interfaces for props
- ARIA accessibility attributes
- Responsive design considerations
- Touch-friendly sizing

### API Reference

**Telegram Web App HapticFeedback API**:
```typescript
window.Telegram.WebApp.HapticFeedback.impactOccurred('light' | 'medium' | 'heavy' | 'rigid' | 'soft')
window.Telegram.WebApp.HapticFeedback.notificationOccurred('error' | 'success' | 'warning')
window.Telegram.WebApp.HapticFeedback.selectionChanged()
```

**@dnd-kit API Usage**:
- `useSortable()` for draggable items
- `DndContext` for drag container
- `SortableContext` for sortable list
- `closestCenter` collision detection
