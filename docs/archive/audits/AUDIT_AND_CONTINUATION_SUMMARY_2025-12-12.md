2. **Security Updates**
   - esbuild <=0.24.2 (dev-only, moderate)
   - vite 0.11.0-6.1.6 (dev-only, moderate)
   - Plan: Update to vite 7.x in next major release

3. **Code Quality**
   - 71 files with console.log remaining
   - Lint errors in Edge Functions (mostly `no-explicit-any`)
   - Pattern: Replace with structured logging

4. **Testing**
   - Manual testing for T059-T060 (requires production)
   - E2E tests for payment flows (future enhancement)

### Tracked for Future Sprints
