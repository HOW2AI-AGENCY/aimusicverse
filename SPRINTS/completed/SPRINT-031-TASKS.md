# Tasks: Sprint 031 - Optimization Phase 2

**Input**: Design documents from `/SPRINTS/`
**Prerequisites**: SPRINT-031-PLAN.md ✅, SPRINT-031-RESEARCH.md ✅, SPRINT-031-DATA-MODEL.md ✅, SPRINT-031-QUICKSTART.md ✅

**Tests**: Unit tests and E2E tests ARE included for validation (per Sprint 031 requirements)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by sprint phase to enable independent implementation and validation of each optimization area.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Phase] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies on incomplete tasks)
- **[Phase]**: Which sprint phase this task belongs to (PH2, PH3, PH4, PH5, PH6)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- Paths assume mobile-first web application (Telegram Mini App)

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Store Unification (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS component optimizations
- **Component Optimizations (Phase 3)**: Depends on Store Unification completion
- **DAW Timeline (Phase 4)**: Can run in parallel with Phase 3 (different files)
- **Testing (Phase 5)**: Depends on Phases 2-4 complete (runs in parallel during development)
- **Cleanup (Phase 6)**: Depends on Phases 2-5 complete

### Critical Path

1. **Phase 1 (Setup)** → 30min
2. **Phase 2 (Store Unification)** → 5.5 hours ⚠️ BLOCKS Phase 3
3. **Phase 3 (Component Optimizations)** → 6 hours (can overlap with Phase 4)
4. **Phase 4 (DAW Timeline)** → 6.5 hours (can overlap with Phase 3)
5. **Phase 5 (Testing)** → 8 hours (runs in parallel with 2-4)
6. **Phase 6 (Cleanup)** → 2.75 hours

**Timeline**: ~34.75 hours total (~1 week for single developer)

### Parallel Opportunities

**Setup Phase (Phase 1):**
```bash
# All can run together:
T002: Update package.json exports
T003: Configure size-limit
T004: Update jest.config.js
```

**Store Unification (Phase 2):**
```bash
# Can run in parallel after T008 (interface exists):
T009: Create slice type interfaces
T010: Compose playbackSlice
T011: Compose stemMixerSlice
```

**Component Optimizations (Phase 3):**
```bash
# After Phase 2 complete, can run in parallel:
T025: Create OptimizedLyricsLine
T028: Create OptimizedLyricsPanel
T033: Create OptimizedPlaylistItem
T038: Create lyrics parser
```

**DAW Timeline (Phase 4):**
```bash
# Can run in parallel with Phase 3:
T043: Create BPM detection
T047: Create beat-snap utilities
T057: Create RAF throttling
```

**Testing (Phase 5):**
```bash
# All benchmarks can run in parallel:
T074: Scroll FPS benchmark
T075: Mixer re-render benchmark
T076: Waveform load benchmark
T077: Memory profiling
```

---

## Parallel Example: Phase 2 (Store Unification)

```bash
# After T008 creates interface, launch slice composition together:
Task: "Compose playbackSlice in src/stores/useUnifiedStudioStore.ts"
Task: "Compose stemMixerSlice in src/stores/useUnifiedStudioStore.ts"
Task: "Create slice type interfaces in src/stores/slices/unifiedSlice.ts"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (Phase 2 Only - Store Unification)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (30min)
2. Complete Phase 2: Store Unification (5.5h) 🎯 **MVP**
3. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test mixer re-reduction independently
4. Deploy/demo if ready

**MVP Success Criteria:**
- Mixer channel re-renders: 1 per volume change (from ~10)
- No state duplication errors
- Selectors preventing unnecessary re-renders

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Phase 1 + Phase 2 → Store unification working ✅ **MVP**
2. Add Phase 3 → Component optimizations working
3. Add Phase 4 → Timeline improvements working
4. Phase 5 → All metrics validated
5. Phase 6 → Documentation complete

**Each phase adds value without breaking previous work**

## Success Metrics Validation

### Performance Benchmarks (Target: Mid-range Devices)

| Metric | Before | Target | Validation Task |
|--------|--------|--------|------------------|
| TrackList scroll FPS | ~30 | 60 | T074 |
| Mixer re-renders/volume change | ~10 | 1 | T075 |
| Waveform load (cached) | ~500ms | <50ms | T076 |
| Bundle size (studio) | ~200KB | <180KB | T086 |
| Memory (10 stems) | ~150MB | <100MB | T077 |

### Quality Metrics

- Test coverage ≥80% for new hooks: T078, T079, T080, T081, T082 ✅
- All P1 TODO items resolved or documented: T097 ✅
- Documentation updated: T090, T091, T092, T093 ✅

## Notes

- **[P] tasks** = different files, no dependencies on incomplete tasks
- **[Phase] label** maps task to specific sprint phase for traceability
- Each phase should be independently completable and testable
- Phase 2 is BLOCKING - must complete before Phase 3 can start
- Phases 3 and 4 can run in parallel after Phase 2 complete
- Phase 5 runs in parallel with Phases 2-4 (tests written during development)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate phase independently
