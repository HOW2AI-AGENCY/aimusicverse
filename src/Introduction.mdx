# Welcome to the MusicVerse AI Design System

This design system is the single source of truth for the UI components of MusicVerse AI. It's a living document that will evolve with the project.

Our goal is to create a consistent, beautiful, and accessible user experience. This system provides a collection of reusable components, guidelines, and principles to help us achieve that.

## Principles

- **Consistent:** Components should look and behave predictably across the entire application.
- **Reusable:** Build components in a way that they can be used in multiple contexts.
- **Accessible:** Ensure that the application is usable by everyone, regardless of their abilities.
- **Efficient:** A shared component library speeds up development and reduces redundant work.

## How to use this guide

This Storybook is organized into several sections:

- **Design System:** Contains the foundational elements of our design language, such as colors, typography, and spacing.
- **UI:** A library of our base-level, "atomic" components like buttons, inputs, and cards.
- **Components:** More complex, composite components built from the UI elements.
- **Pages:** Examples of full screens to show how components come together to form the application.
